# Japanese-Stroke-Order
Author: Logan Endes (github.com/Log45)
stroke.py is a program for Japanese learners to remember the stroke order of 
different letters in hiragana and katakana. While it is not extremely accurate 
with regard to the exact shape of every letter, it it useful for remembering stroke
orders, something that I personally find myself struggling with.
